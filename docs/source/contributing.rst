============

PV Drone Inspect is non-profit and open source. As such we rely on your contribution to make this project even more awesome. Below I will describe some open research avenues you may want to look into. If you want to work on any of these or have own ideas on how to improve the project, feel free to open an issue on GitHub for further discussion.

PV module segmentation
----------------------

As mention in the :doc:`lmitations`, PV module segmentation is currently robust for PV plants with row-based layout, but has issues with rooftop plants.


Use of visual videos in addition to IR videos
---------------------------------------------


Extension to EL/PL Imaging
--------------------------

Apart from thermal IR imaging there exist other imaging techniques, such as electroluminescence (EL) or photoluminescence (PL) imaging, for the inspection of PV plants. An interesting line of research is the extension of PV Drone Inspect to these imaging techniques.
