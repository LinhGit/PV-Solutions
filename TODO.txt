- finish docs
- fix run_test workflows
- add badges
- add logo

- zip the patches of each module using Python ZipFile


Docs:

camera calibration:
[maybe it is sufficient to provide the rough parameters, i.e. correct focal length, perfect image center and zero distortion]
[mention that these are only initial parameters and they are further optimized during the OpenSfM procedure]
[mention option to perform calibration with a custom script or matlab and provide camera matrix and distortion coefficients manually as JSON file]
