TODO:

- continue writing tests (create unit test and integration test folder)
- write tutorial and finish docs
- fix automatic release and runt_test workflows


- upload files (example datasets, model weights) to release assets and download automatically from there if not found locally

- remove preview images to make user experience easier (modify view_gps.py which uses preview images), update docs (using your own data)
- remove split_tiffs and rotate step and move into scripts directory (also put split_seqs there), update docs accordingly (using your own data)
- move cropping after mapping and consider merged modules directly in the cropping, so that we can prevent copying the patches folder to patches_final
- zip the patches of each module using Python ZipFile



Docs:
- write docs locally
- merge docs with master branch and push
- activate github pages
- install sphinx-video in requirements.txt so that docs can be built with github workflow
